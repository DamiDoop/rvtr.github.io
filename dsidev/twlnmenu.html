TwlNmenu is a title manager similar to DevMenu for 3DS. TwlNmenu can install programs in the TAD format, which is an installable format created by Nintendo, similar to the Wii's WADs. <h3>What's this "TAD" thing?</h3>
<div style="padding-left:2%;">
  <i>"The installable format, TAD share many similarities to the WAD format, including the same offsets for title ID's and using the same devsign as WADs. A TAD can be resigned using Wii resigning tools and a RVL devkey. However, due to TwlNmenu's anti-tampering methods, the tool lets you not install resigned TAD files."</i> - <a href="https://wiki.raregamingdump.ca/index.php?title=TwlNmenu">RGDWiki</a>

<br>TADs are essentially SRLs (NDS ROMs) that have been packaged into an installable format. TAD files can be created with <code>
  <a href="/dsidev/man/maketad.html" target="_blank">maketad.exe</a>
</code>, from the TwlSDK (<code>TwlSDK/tools/bin/maketad.exe</code>). Only apps that are installed to the <code>00030004</code> folder are able to be converted to TAD <h4 style="color:red;">Note: DO NOT install TADs on a retail DSi.</h4>Attempting to do so will just result in a <code>-2011</code> error, due to the TAD being unsigned. Resigning the TAD will not work as TwlNmenu protects against this (error code <code>7</code>). Additionally, <span style="color:red;">TwlNmenu will OVERWRITE WHAT IT'S TRYING TO INSTALL</span>, so if it fails, your apps may be deleted. <h3>How can I safely run a TAD?</h3>To run a TAD on retail hardware, you have to decrypt it and extract the SRL. You can use <a href="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/rmc-dsi/decrypt_tad.py">this</a> python script to do so. Usage is <code>python3 decrypt_tad.py [path to file].tad</code>
<br>Rename the SRL to NDS, and it should work in emulators or on real hardware.
