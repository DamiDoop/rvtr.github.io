SD to Photo is a tool that copies all photos from the SD card to the photo region of NAND. It preserves the filepaths, so <code>sd:/DCIM/100NIN02/HNI_0001.JPG</code> will be stored in NAND as <code>photo:/DCIM/100NIN02/HNI_0001.JPG</code>.<br><br>The app will first display a black screen (loading), switch to red (copying photos), and end on blue (finished).
