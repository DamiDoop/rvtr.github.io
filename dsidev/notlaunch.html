	These are used to demonstrate how applications installed to NAND can be hidden from the home menu through a build flag. This flag is used for hiding things such as the WiFi Firmware and DS Cart Whitelist since they are not bootable, and the Nintendo Zone app.
	<br><br>
	The NotLaunch programs will not appear on the home menu when installed, and the apps do nothing when run. This is the entire program code:<br><br>
<table class="code-div"><tr><td><pre>
void TwlMain(void)
{
    OS_Init();
    
    
    
    OS_Terminate();
}
</td></tr></table>
