KART appears to be an augmented
<br><br>
There are 4 main versions of KART. 
<br>
<code> - KART</code>, the m
<code> - KART2</code> and <code>KARTn2</code>, the same as KART but it has an additional model called "cube"
<code> - KART (cartridge)</code>,


<br><br>
The KART programs were recovered from a collection of development mode <a href="https://wiki.raregamingdump.ca/index.php/Nintendo_DS_Classroom">Classroom DSis</a>. KART may have been a scrapped feature for use in the classroom.<br>The release page for the DSis can be found <a href="/dsidev/release/dev-nands.html">here.</a>


What surprised us is, of course, this camera KART application. As of writing, we haven't fully figured out what it does, but what it's supposed to do is clear from its title. This is a simple application testing the possibilities of AR functionality in a classroom setting. AR with a VGA 0.3-megapixel camera, I know. On the bottom are FPS and frame recognition counters, which appears to shoot up whenever the software recognizes a certain pattern, sort of like the AR Cards bundled with the Nintendo 3DS. While we haven't gotten anything to display, we did find some models buried in the files of Pikachu, a figure from a game we didn't recognize, and (exclusive to camera KART 2/n2) a folding game console that might've revealed the figurine.

A cartridge version of the app was also dumped - sort of, we couldn't produce a good dump, but with the help of two different dumping tools, we managed to produce something that the DSi will happily read - that doesn't have any of these models, but does let you pause the screen in different ways (B/Start/Select), switch between the inner/outer cameras (X) and increase the FPS up to 30 (Y), which causes the screen to split near the bottom. Maybe the installed applications and this cartridge would've communicated with eachother. We haven't been able to test this as of writing, since we couldn't get the cartridge version to run on melonDS.

What's strange is that these applications were built with an IS-TWL-Debugger library from March 2010, just a month before the program supposedly launched, suggesting that AR was just an afterthought for potential (future) software if the program sold well.
