EC file utility is used when developers can't connect to the DSi Shop. This app can view <code>ec.cfg</code>, delete <code>ec.cfg</code>, <code>shop.log</code> and <code>dev.kp</code>, and delete itself.<br>According to the document EC file utility came with, deleting <code>dev.kp</code> should fix any connection issues.<br><br>This application was only released to developers that had issues connecting to the DSi Shop, and sharing this among other developers was strictly prohibited. So much so that you had to completely delete the app after using it.
