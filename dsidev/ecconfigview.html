EC file utility was for development units that have trouble connecting to the DSi Shop. This app can view <code>ec.cfg</code>, delete <code>ec.cfg</code>, <code>shop.log</code> and <code>dev.kp</code>, and delete itself. According to the document EC file utility came with, deleting <code>dev.kp</code> is all that was needed to fix connection issues.<br><br>This application was only released to developers with DSi Shop issues, and sharing it among other developers was strictly prohibited. So much so that developers were instructed completely delete the app after using it.
