        Mic Tester appears to be a factory testing app for the DS microphone and speakers. As of writing this, there are two known versions of Mic Tester.
        <h2>2007/05/07 (v4):</h2>
        This version  uses a UI similar to that of <a href="/dsidev/nitroeva.html">NTR Aging/Nitro EVA</a>. It comes with 4 major tests:
<br><code> - SOUND</code>, Plays some simple sound effects and music to test the speakers
<br><code> - MIC</code>, A few microphone tests. One is the <code>SAMPLING DATA GRAPH</code>, which displays a real time graph of the mic input.
<br><code> - MIC CHECKER</code>, Appears to be another microphone test, though it's impossible to use as it requires special factory hardware
<br><code> - SPEAKER TESTER</code>, Plays a tone in the left and right speakers to make sure they're working
<br><br>This also comes with the standard NTR Aging tests like:
<br><code> - Reception</code>
<br><code> - COMM TEST</code>
<br><code> - Port Checker</code>
<br><code> - ROM HEADER</code>, Display cartridge header info

        <h2>2008/12/01:</h2>
        This later version has had nearly  feature stripped, with the exception of <code>SPEAKER TESTER</code>. It does not have the NTR Aging styled menu or any of the tests mentioned above.
