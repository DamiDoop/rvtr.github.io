It all started during a discussion with my friend @ufo. He was wanting to install iQue firmware on a non-iQue unit, but it wouldn't work. I took a look and noticed that the iQue firmware was 512kb as opposed to the regular 256kb size for other firmwares.
<br>@ufo said, "it would be cool to get ique to work on the 256 ones", and that got me thinking...
<br><br>
The 256kb chip on the DS WiFi card that holds the firmware is the exact same as the 256kb save chip on most DS games. You can swap a firmware and save chip around and everything works perfectly- assuming you correctly flashed the firmware to the now-firmware chip.
<br>The same likely goes for the iQue, but instead it would just be a 512kb chip that's commonly found in DS games.
<br>The iQue also shares all the same hardware with a normal DS, so what if the WiFi boards were the exact same minus the chip capacities?
<br><br>
I decided to start ripping apart a couple shovelware games with 512kb save files in order to identify the chips. This was all so that me and another guy could try making iQue WiFi cards without the guilt of destroying good cartridges. Sadly the chips were privately made and none of us could find the actual part. I figured I'd just go with the cartridges I already disassembled and moved on.
<br><br>
Quickly though I realized I made a huge mistake. I had misread the save chips, and all that shovelware was 512 bytes! My only carts with 512kb save chips were my beloved Pokemon games... I couldn't pop one open, could I?
<br><br>
Eh, what the hell. I can put it back together later. I flashed the iQue firmware with gm9i and gently opened the cartridge. I made sure I was real careful to cleanly remove the chip so I could put it back later. I was afraid I'd remove a pad on the cartridge but a bit of flux got it off nicely.

<br>
Next was the WiFi card. The WiFi card gave me a bit of trouble with a small capacitor right beside the chip. I was afraid to break that and ended up marking up the board pretty good. At least it and the chip were intact!

<br>
Now it was time to put Pokemon's save chip into the WiFi board. Boy, was that hard. My shaky hands kept moving the chip, and in the end it was slightly offset. Thankfully there wasn't any bridging. I decided to put it in the DS lite.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1675656997779.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
I eagerly put it in, turned on the power, and... nothing. Black screens. This meant it couldn't read the firmware. I figured maybe I put the chip on backwards. I moved it around and somehow made it look worse. It was no longer offset, but it was very... crusty. As long as it works I'm happy though.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1675657047543.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
This time I stuck it in and hit the power. It felt like more than a few seconds before the screens lit up. iQue DS, my console said. I had done it. I had just turned my north american console into an iQue one!
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1675657142677.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
I'm happy to have done this. I've never been first in anything, so to be the first one to (publicly) make an iQue console from a normal one, I felt proud. I did it.
<br><br>
Hopefully this was mildly interesting. I might make proper guide along with the necessary info on chips/games with good chips to create your own iQue WiFi card. Let me know down below if that's of any interest to you. See y'all later!

I bought another DS console, bringing my collection to 2 DSi XLs, 1 DSi, 1 2DS, and 2 DS lites. I know I need to stop, but I couldn't help it when I saw this $20 DS lite.
<br>

<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671474487703.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
Sure, it may have had years of grime and a nasty crust all over it, but I thought it was cleanable. It looked much more yellow in real life, but these photos were the best I could do.
I started cleaning by completely taking the DS lite apart. (btw like my workstation? Just a wooden board on a floor with parts all over. Totally a great way not to loose all my screws)
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671474703329.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
It smelled awful. It was like old food had been left inside to rot, and perfume was added to make the smell go away. Yuck! The individual parts reflected the smell quite well.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671474845792.png" style="width:32.2%;height:auto;">

<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671474884555.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<br>
Absolutely disgusting. How do these consoles fall into this state? Oh well, at least it's in good hands now.
I started my cleaning with the DS stylus thing. It appeared like there was a bug living in there at one point. Pulling the web like substance out was not very pleasant. Thankfully it wasn't hard to remove, and all the grime came off with a single swab of alcohol.
<br><br>
Next I started the back panel. Dear god. The yellow-orange stuff was sticky and smelly. I don't know what it smelled like but it was just bad. I think that's enough. I doused the plate in more alcohol and eventually it came off... in gross flakes. In the end it looked pretty nice. Well worth the cleaning.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671475545891.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
Next up, the screen. This was awful to clean. The crust came off okay, it was more below the crust that was a problem. The screen must've been covered in grease, because every time I cleaned it and wiped it down I just got shiny streaks all over. I went through 3 or so cotton swabs before it went away. Once clean I had a nice mirror.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671475802508.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
I did some of the other parts and then I finished the top bottom part. This one had dirt/grease/finger juices soaked into it. When I put alcohol on it, it immediately turned a brownish grey color. I had to soak it for a few minutes before it would all come off. Rinsed it off and had another nice part.
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671476089427.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
The rest of the console was pretty boring. The hinges had a lot of dust but that came out with some compressed air. I put it back together and...
<br>
<img src="/assets/dsi/blog/1671476313326.png" style="width:40%;height:auto;">
<br>
Wow that looks nice. The screens are dirty again from me assembling the console, but they'll be good after I wipe them with a cloth. The console has turned from a white-yellow color to a nice warm white. The one hinge part could use some retrobriting, but other than that I'm pretty happy with it. $20 bucks and a couple hours of cleaning got me this beauty. Normally I'd have to pay $60 to $80, so I'd say I got off pretty well.
<br><br>
A new DS lite means a new WiFi card, so I installed the other prototype firmware on my "bad" WiFi card (the proto firmware seems to permanently break wireless communications, so I am only going to use one card for that). I found out that it works, so woohoo. I wrote a guide on installing it and maybe I'll share it in the DS section. Or maybe not in case some idiots try it and brick their consoles. Easy to fix a bad flash, but still upsetting when people mess things up.
<br><br>
Okay, that's all. I should probably stop buying consoles, but it's so fun! There was another bad $20 DS lite and I'm trying my hardest not to save it. Maybe I'll cave and clean that one too lol]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stuff" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did it again...

Yes that's right, he wanted me to take apart and put back together a whole fucking 3DS in the middle of a park. I insisted inside would be better but he refused.

I thought I'd never have to touch this poor console again. I was wrong.<h3>October, 2022:&nbsp;</h3>It was early october and I was eating lunch with friends in the school hallways. I was having a good day... until he arrived. Out of nowhere the 3DS abuser appeared. After months of silence, he came back to complain that he yet again broke his console. He dropped it on the table, said nothing more than "please fix it", and left.
<br><br>
When I got home I immediately turned it on. And then I immediately started screaming and hitting my wall because WHY, WHY COULD HE NOT JUST BUY A NEW FUCKING 3DS!?

But no... he didn't think it was that bad. Just slather a glue stick on and it's all good. Please spare me this torture. PLEASE.
<br><br>
Anyways, he forced me to take it back. I tried multiple different glues with no luck. I spent a couple weeks trying to figure out any way to get it to stay. Eventually I went with a cheap as fuck super glue and it seemed to hold. I left it over night, closed the hinge and <i>SNAP</i>. It came undone. Again. I was done.

I&apos;m back. I checked the ribbon cables and one of them was slightly loose. I put it in properly this time.<br><img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/hni_0009-jpg.294339/" style="width:43.8%;height:auto;"><br>(decided to try my flashcart, cause I haven&apos;t used it in a while and wanted to see if it worked. It does! Maybe I can do ntrboot with it)
<br><br>
I&apos;m nearly done. I still have to fix the charging port, the case, and hack the console. This supposedly &quot;already hacked&quot; 3DS doesn&apos;t appear to be hacked. It might have been, but I&apos;m doubtful.<br><br>I also found more issues with it. The cartridge and SD slots are disgusting, some of the screw holes are stripped (same goes for the screws), the R button&apos;s ribbon cable has been cut, and the wireless slider isn&apos;t working (should be easy enough to fix, I think it is just loose). He wants me to go out and buy a new battery (and probably a new R button), so I guess I&apos;ll do that sometime soon. He&apos;s paying for it, and I&apos;m getting some flashcarts, so I guess it&apos;s worth the time.

I checked the ribbon cables and one of them was slightly loose. I put it in properly this time.(decided to try my flashcart, cause I haven&apos;t used it in a while and wanted to see if it worked. It does! Maybe I can do ntrboot with it) I&apos;m nearly done. I still have to fix the charging port, the case, and hack the console. This supposedly &quot;already hacked&quot; 3DS doesn&apos;t appear to be hacked. It might have been, but I&apos;m doubtful.I also found more issues with it. The cartridge and SD slots are disgusting, some of the screw holes are stripped (same goes for the screws), the R button&apos;s ribbon cable has been cut, and the wireless slider isn&apos;t working (should be easy enough to fix, I think it is just loose). He wants me to go out and buy a new battery (and probably a new R button), so I guess I&apos;ll do that sometime soon. He&apos;s paying for it, and I&apos;m getting some flashcarts, so I guess it&apos;s worth the time. But, as Mr. DeadSkullzJr said,I&apos;ll see you in part 3.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hacked poor 3DS</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/01/19/2-hacked_poor_3ds.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hacked poor 3DS" /><published>2022-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/01/19/2-hacked_poor_3ds</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/01/19/2-hacked_poor_3ds.html"><![CDATA[I played around with the 3D effects for a bit (I&apos;ve only ever had a 2DS, so it was neat to see), then set up my flashcart.

He had bricked it back in 2018, and had no idea what to do.<img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/13_06_00_0-png.294245/" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>Note: the hinge is purely cosmetic. His friend dropped it a bit before it got bricked
<br><br>I took the 3DS and looked it over. I felt sorry for that thing. The top screen was barely connected (it was hanging from the top screen&apos;s cables), it wouldn&apos;t charge, and it wouldn&apos;t turn on. He said he bricked it with a flashcart, but he only has an R4. I heard that you can&apos;t brick a 3DS with an R4, so I have no clue what happened. Anyways, I took it apart and tried to first see why it wouldn&apos;t charge. The board was in surprisingly good condition.<br><img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/00_00_37_0-png.294249/" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/00_00_46_0-png.294250/" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>
I flipped the board over and checked the fuses, but those weren&apos;t the issue. I noticed the charging port was very wobbly and I took a closer look. The thing was barely soldered onto the board. Only one pin was still soldered to the board, and the rest were barely making contact. I asked and he said that he had work done on it before. Whoever replaced/fixed it before really didn&apos;t do a good job. That, or the solder they used was horrible and came off long after.<br><img src="https://gbatemp.net/attachments/00_02_02_0-png.294251/" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>
I&apos;ve still got to put it back on (and do it properly unlike that person) and test it out. Then I&apos;ll need to figure out how to fix the brick, if it is actually bricked (it probably is. It sounded exactly like when I broke my 3DS&apos;s NAND). Stay tuned for part 2 of me trying to fix a 3DS.]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stuff" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today a friend gave my his 3DS to fix.
