<br><br><h2>This is an interactive demo of the developer DSi Shop.</h2>The developer DSi shop uses a modified version of the DSi Browser, and most of its content is local HTML/JS. Because the app is almost entirely HTML/JS, I was able to take the HTML pages from romfs and format them to work on your browser.<br><br>Sadly, many of the pages are missing- locked behind Nintendo's development servers or just straight up gone. I patched things up wherever possible, killing any dead links and linking to otherwise unlinked pages.<br>Features such as the console information and DSi specific operations are also missing/broken (as is to be expected when you're running a DSi app on a PC). I tried filling in the blanks where I could, but it still has a way to go.<br>If you want to help polish up the code, feel free to submit a PR <a href="https://github.com/IanSkinner1982/ianskinner1982.github.io/tree/master/gaming/htmls">here.</a><br>

I have found 3 different versions of this app. I am not sure what the differences between the apps are, though I will look into that.<br>
I used the files from <i><b>DSi Shop (Debug) (shop.HNFC.Release.v1536.tad).srl</b></i> for my demo.
<br><br>

<a href="/assets/dsi/DSi Shop (shop.HNFC.Release.14231.tad).srl">DSi Shop (shop.HNFC.Release.14231.tad).srl</a><br>
<a href="/assets/dsi/DSi Shop (shop.HNFC.Release.thumb.tad).srl">DSi Shop (shop.HNFC.Release.thumb.tad).srl</a><br><br>
I have only gotten <i><b>DSi Shop (Debug) (shop.HNFC.Release.v1536.tad).srl</b></i> to work on a DSi by installing it to NAND, but hiyaCFW may work as well (I haven't tested that yet). Using nds-bootstrap, unlaunch, or any similar apps will introduce problems, such as the touch controls being broken, or even causing the developer DSi Shop not to boot.
<br><br>
As for the other two DSi Shop versions, booting via NAND produces a <b>293003</b> error. They do boot on unlaunch, though suffer from broken touch controls.
