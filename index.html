<marquee><code style="font-size:2.5vw;color:green;" scrollamount="10">Greetings to ufo, lasscat, togemet2, Rolfie, HudU, xp, Haifisch, MaxiBash, NinjaCheetah, scalr, and collection_nintendo! Thanks to everyone  across the web who has dumped, mirrored, or documented these programs. This entire website  was designed and created by me, and me alone (unless you count stack overflow). Sure, it's barely working, but at least it looks nicer and has more information than any other public sites. Y'all need to remember that there's more than just TwlNmenu and NandFiler. Also just include damn links! These programs don't do any good when you can't download and use them. Oh well, at least I've fixed that now... unless you're on my GBAtemp branch. Sorry for the stripped down site. I don't have much of a choice with GBAtemp's silly rules.</code></marquee>

<span style="font-size:2vw;"><a href="/dsidev/release/dev-nands.html">Various development NANDs released</a></span><br>
8 new NANDs and 1 dev cart have been jointly released with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/collection_nintendo/" target="_blank">@collection_nintendo</a>, me, MaxiBash, and xp. These NAND dumps are mainly consist of test Classroom DSis, used later in development for attempt at augmented reality. Check it out!

<h2>Welcome to the DS(i) dev app archive!</h2></div>

<p>This website is aimed at documenting every single Nintendo DS(i) development and factory test program ever released. Many programs have been leaked or dumped, but they're rarely discussed publicly and I worry that they will get lost to time. This site exists to ensure that these apps are always available, along with some documentation.
<br><br>
If you want to support this project, send me programs/documents/information via <a href="mailto:lillian@randommeaninglesscharacters.com">my email</a>, or join the discussion in my <a href="https://discord.gg/se9yQBeX3e">discord server</a>. I'm happy to answer any questions you have (no matter how silly they may be), so don't be afraid to shoot me a message.<br><br>Also check out some of my guides and info pages linked in the nav bar!

RGD, your articles are crap,
All half assed content worthless as scrap.
You say your wiki is a good resource,
I'm sorry to say I can't find your source.

Your NandFiler page is shit as can be,
Unmentioned backup capabilities.
You missed the hidden fill.bmp,
This is all very important don't you see?

SystemUpdater installs some cool TADs,
But they're a weird format which makes me sads.
This is kinda interesting to know,
But you don't add it, you will just say no.

TwlNmenu's page sucks too,
The information and wording is poo
Neither TwlNmenu, huh?
Clarify "either", there's only one, duh.

Your articles are lacking, just three apps,
Don't you know there's dozens more, give some craps!

Your site is shit, mine is not, take a lesson plz.
Go to really moist coochie dot x y z
