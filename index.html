<marquee class="scroller"><code style="font-size:40px;" scrollamount="10">Greetings to ufo, lasscat, togemet2, Rolfie, HudU, xp, Haifisch, MaxiBash, NinjaCheetah, DamiDoop, scalr, pancake, and collection_nintendo! Thanks to everyone  across the web who has dumped, mirrored, or documented these programs. This entire website  was designed and created by me, and me alone (unless you count stack overflow). Sure, it's barely working, but at least it looks nicer and has more information than any other public sites. Y'all need to remember that there's more than just TwlNmenu and NandFiler. Also just include damn links! These programs don't do any good when you can't download and use them. Oh well, at least I've fixed that now... unless you're on my GBAtemp branch. Sorry for the stripped down site. I don't have much of a choice with silly terms of service and DMCA stuff.</code></marquee>

<p>This is a work in progress archive of Nintendo DS(i) development and factory software. This is not only a collection of files, but also full documentation to match.
<br><br>
My archive includes anything used in the production of the DS or DSi (eg. diagnostic and setup tools), software bundled with the SDK, prototype and development software, and any tests used for debugging.
<br><br>
I've researched and released a few prototypes through this site, so please <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a> if you've got a development cart/unit in need of dumping.
<br><br>
Most of the pages here are written by me and me alone. As such, there's a good chance I'm missing or have incorrect information. If you have time to contribute, please check out the edit button on the top of each page or <a href="/contact.html">tell me</a> what's wrong.

RGD, your articles are crap,
All half assed content worthless as scrap.
You say your wiki is a good resource,
I'm sorry to say I can't find your source.

Your NandFiler page is shit as can be,
Unmentioned backup capabilities.
You missed the hidden fill.bmp,
This is all very important don't you see?

SystemUpdater installs some cool TADs,
But they're a weird format which makes me sads.
This is kinda interesting to know,
But you don't add it, you will just say no.

TwlNmenu's page sucks too,
The information and wording is poo
Neither TwlNmenu, huh?
Clarify "either", there's only one, duh.

Your articles are lacking, just three apps,
Don't you know there's dozens more, give some craps!

Your site is shit, mine is not, take a lesson plz.
Go to really moist coochie dot x y z

Edit: woah this sucks. But the message still goes hard.
