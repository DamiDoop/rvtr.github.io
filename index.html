        <p>Hey all! I'm Ian Skinner, though you may have seen me in some Nintendo DS communities as "rmc",  or "IS1982". I do a lot of documentation and archival of <a href="/dsidev/">Nintendo DS(i) development programs</a>, nature photography, and a little bit of walking. This site was intended to show off all the projects I've worked on, though most of what I do is in the "real world" and doesn't transfer over to a website well. Maybe I'll find something in the future.<br><br>Hate the theme?  I purposely designed this part of the website to look bad/outdated/tacky.  I couldn't think of a good theme so I figured a bad theme works just as well. It's like that thing my grandpa said a few times: "When things don't go right, go left."<br>Except instead of going left vs. right, I'm going terrible vs. great.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Stuff I've done:</h3>

        <a href="https://archive.org/details/@is1982?query=CBM+8-Bit+Magazine+Index&sort=titleSorter">Commodore Magazine Archive</a>
        <ul>My dad and I have created well organized and complete magazine archives for Commodore 8-bits. All the other collections on the web are missing pages, disorganized, and full of inconsistent names. These collections have been improved upon with missing pages added, and by making comprehensible file paths.</ul>

        <a href="https://archive.org/details/rmc-photos/buildings/20220612_161352.jpg">Photography</a>
        <ul>This is a collection of photos I've taken. I mostly do pictures of nature (at least on my end, though most of my nature photos don't make it to the intenet),  but I also love empty buildings and Nintendo DSis. I used an old S6 phone (SM-G920W8) for most of these.</ul>

       <a href="/pages/studentportal/studentportal_login.html">Student Portal Snapshot (????-2022)</a>
        <ul>Normally school board student portals are pretty boring. This one isn't. Imagine a shitty 90s website built for IE 7.0 that only half works... but you're forced to use it in the 2020s for all your course info, grades, and  appointments.<br><br>This is just the frontend of the student portal, so you can't actually log in. You can still enter the portal without needing any credentials, just don't expect to check your grades or attendance records (or mine for that matter).</ul>
