<br><br><br>Note that I had to fill in dummy system info, most of the stuff is broken and won't work, and some formatting is messed up. idk how to fix that stuff, but feel free to submit a pr if you know how.<br>Also if a link doesn't work, it's probably because it links to a dead site or non existant page, so I stopped it from working.<br><br>This is just to give an idea of how the prototype shop looked. To experience the real thing, download the .nds file <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857312389543493706/857320516913725471/DSi_Shop_Debug_shop.HNFC.Release.v1536.tad.srl">here</a> (may only work through hiyaCFW or NAND install).
