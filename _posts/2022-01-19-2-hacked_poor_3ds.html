I played around with the 3D effects for a bit (I&apos;ve only ever had a 2DS, so it was neat to see), then set up my flashcart. I flashed ntrboot, looked for a magnet, held some buttons, and I was on the b9s installer.<br>

I did it! I hacked that sad little console. There was one problem though... I was wrong about two things. The trigger button with the broken ribbon cable was actually the left one (so no rosalina menu &apos;cause you need L+down+select), and the right trigger button was broken for some other reason. So yeah, both of those are gone. I&apos;ll send an email to the store, and hopefully they&apos;ll have a scrap 3DS. I need those parts!<br><br>
I was told that I could just change the menu combo, so I did. It works perfectly.

Now I&apos;ve got to focus on that charging port. I&apos;m heating up the soldering gun right now.

I&apos;m back. I was afraid I&apos;d break something, but I didn&apos;t mess up!<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-19-poor-poor-3ds-part-three/HNI_0013.JPG" style="width:43.8%;height:auto;">

Anyways, it charges! All I need now are the two new buttons, and a new battery. I&apos;m going to try cleaning the housing and the board a bit more, then I&apos;ll get back to setting up all the apps (FBI, Universal Updater, etc). I think that&apos;ll be it. That, and trying to figure out how to rescue that shell, if possible. I&apos;ll try superglue tomorrow, and if that doesn&apos;t work, I&apos;ll send another email asking about shells.<br><br>I&apos;m happy with my progress. I started this at 4:15 PM yesterday, and it&apos;s 7:33 PM as of writing this.<br><br>Alright, I&apos;ll see you in the next entry. Hopefully by then I&apos;ll hear back about the parts. Bye!<br><br>(also the thing feels like it&apos;ll just fall apart in my hands. Very creaky. At least I can&apos;t say that was my fault)
