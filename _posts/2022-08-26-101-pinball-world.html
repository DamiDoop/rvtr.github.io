101 Pinball World, released by Tenyon, is the worst pinball game imaginable for DSi. It looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap and rushed piece of crap... probably because it is.
<br><br>
This game has 4 "different" worlds (each themed after halloween, space, wizards, and pirates), with each 34 levels each. Each level was sloppily put together with repetitive graphics and game breaking object placement. All levels in one world are the exact same as all levels in the other worlds, just with a the textures changed. Most of those levels play okay, but some are god awful. There are many times that the bumpers are placed so that if a side spring saves your ball, the bumper will send it right back down. Or so that when you first launch your ball, the bumpers will send it back to the start. Or so that when a ball comes out of a chute, the bumpers will send it right down the middle and through your paddles. You get the idea.
<br><br>
If you somehow manage to ignore the horrible level design and look, you'll notice a lot of other things wrong with this game. The ball jerkily jumps around the screen. Sometimes it just stops for half a second and then appears halfway across the screen. When it continues moving, it can suddenly appear right by your paddles, giving you no time to react.<br>
The ball will also get stuck over and over. It will wedge itself into corners and you can't free it. You can shake the table as many times as you want, but it'll just sit there doing absolutely nothing.
<br><br>
Lastly, the music. Well no, it's not really music. It's just noise. Everything (with the exception of the title screen) is completely out of tune. I really don't know what to say other than it's bad. Just listen for yourself <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xAFhHeACwXg" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
Overall, this game is awful. Poor graphics, sound, level design, gameplay, and it's full of bugs. There's nothing that makes this game good or enjoyable. 1/10. Don't play it.
