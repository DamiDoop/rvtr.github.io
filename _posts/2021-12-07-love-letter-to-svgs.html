<p>I finally reached that point in my life where I learned what an SVG is! Not sure how I made it this far without that knowledge.</p>
<p>If you don't know what vector graphics are, I suggest reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Wikipedia - Scalable Vector Graphics</a> first. To sum it up briefly, SVGs are made of geometric shapes instead of pixels so they can be easily scaled up without losing quality.</p>
<p>Currently I'm only making brand new images as SVGs, but I intend to remake some other old images, especially the banners on this site. If you have a really big monitor (or at least one that's really high res), you can really see this difference by visiting either <a href="/">the homepage</a> or <a href="/programs">the programs page</a> and then <a href="/products/icons">our icon sales page</a> <i>(hmm what could this be)</i> and scroll down to the banner. Now, uh, I don't have a high-res screen (in fact my MacBook Pro is the last pre-Retina display) so I have no idea if this will work. But it probably should. Feel free to yell at me in an issue or something if this doesn't work.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Look forward to some scalable goodness in the near future.</p>
