<p>101 MiniGolf World by Teyon is a golf game for the DSi. It's nothing special as far as DSiWare goes.
<br><br>
The game starts up with a nice tutorial on how to play. It goes over all the controls in about 20 seconds and doesn't leave you confused.
<br>
The controls are very straightforward, and I have no complaints in that regard. Use the touch screen to move the camera, and hit the ball icon when you're ready to shoot. To shoot, you slide the stylus against the touchscreen. Sliding faster makes the ball go further, and vice versa.
<br><br>
The gameplay itself is what you'd expect from a cheap DSi golf game. There are many obstacles that can make things a bit interesting, however they usually don't add any challenge as you can go around them in a single swing. And don't worry about wasting your swings. The game sets a really high par limit, which you will almost never fail to end within. The unchallenging gameplay makes the game get stale pretty quickly.
<br><br>
The visuals are average, with some very basic 3D models. If the models obstruct your view while playing, they'll fade out. However, some small objects such as grass or flowers will not fade away, and can sometimes make it hard to see your ball.
<br><br>
In the end, this game was one of the more forgettable ones. It was kinda fun for a little bit, but didn't have anything challenging or interesting to offer. I'd give this a 6/10.</p>
