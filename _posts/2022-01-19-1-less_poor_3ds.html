Sorry if I keep on putting out blogs and annoy everyone, but IT WORKS IT WORKS IT WORKS!<br>
Look! I swapped batteries (the original one was completely dead) and it worked!

That really doesn&apos;t look like a brick to me. Unless brick = working perfectly.<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-19-poor-poor-3ds-part-two/HNI_0008.JPG" style="width:43.8%;height:auto;"><br>All it was was the battery. Waaaaaay simpler than I had expected. But, sadly, the bottom screen isn&apos;t displaying anything. It reads my inputs and it glows slightly, but it doesn&apos;t show much. I&apos;ll ask some people in a sever I&apos;m a part of for any ideas. See you then!<br><br>---Fancy transition---<br><br>
I&apos;m back. I checked the ribbon cables and one of them was slightly loose. I put it in properly this time.<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-19-poor-poor-3ds-part-two/HNI_0009.JPG" style="width:43.8%;height:auto;"><br>(decided to try my flashcart, cause I haven&apos;t used it in a while and wanted to see if it worked. It does! Maybe I can do ntrboot with it)
<br><br>
I&apos;m nearly done. I still have to fix the charging port, the case, and hack the console. This supposedly &quot;already hacked&quot; 3DS doesn&apos;t appear to be hacked. It might have been, but I&apos;m doubtful.<br><br>I also found more issues with it. The cartridge and SD slots are disgusting, some of the screw holes are stripped (same goes for the screws), the R button&apos;s ribbon cable has been cut, and the wireless slider isn&apos;t working (should be easy enough to fix, I think it is just loose). He wants me to go out and buy a new battery (and probably a new R button), so I guess I&apos;ll do that sometime soon. He&apos;s paying for it, and I&apos;m getting some flashcarts, so I guess it&apos;s worth the time. But, as Mr. DeadSkullzJr said,<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-19-poor-poor-3ds-part-two/1642608931079.png" style="width:43.8%;height:auto;"><br>I&apos;ll see you in part 3.
