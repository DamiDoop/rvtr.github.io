Today a friend gave my his 3DS to fix. He had bricked it back in 2018, and had no idea what to do.<img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-18-poor-poor-3ds-part-one/13_06_00_0.webp" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>Note: the hinge is purely cosmetic. His friend dropped it a bit before it got bricked
<br><br>I took the 3DS and looked it over. I felt sorry for that thing. The top screen was barely connected (it was hanging from the top screen&apos;s cables), it wouldn&apos;t charge, and it wouldn&apos;t turn on. He said he bricked it with a flashcart, but he only has an R4. I heard that you can&apos;t brick a 3DS with an R4, so I have no clue what happened. Anyways, I took it apart and tried to first see why it wouldn&apos;t charge. The board was in surprisingly good condition.<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-18-poor-poor-3ds-part-one/00_00_37_0.webp" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-18-poor-poor-3ds-part-one/00_00_46_0.webp" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>
I flipped the board over and checked the fuses, but those weren&apos;t the issue. I noticed the charging port was very wobbly and I took a closer look. The thing was barely soldered onto the board. Only one pin was still soldered to the board, and the rest were barely making contact. I asked and he said that he had work done on it before. Whoever replaced/fixed it before really didn&apos;t do a good job. That, or the solder they used was horrible and came off long after.<br><img src="https://cdn.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/blog/2022-01-18-poor-poor-3ds-part-one/00_02_02_0.webp" style="width:40%;height:auto;"><br>
I&apos;ve still got to put it back on (and do it properly unlike that person) and test it out. Then I&apos;ll need to figure out how to fix the brick, if it is actually bricked (it probably is. It sounded exactly like when I broke my 3DS&apos;s NAND). Stay tuned for part 2 of me trying to fix a 3DS.
