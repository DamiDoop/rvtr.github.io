        <ul>
          <li>When wireless communication is enabled, it may take about 20 or 30 seconds to recover from Sleep Mode.</li>
          <li>The system sometimes does not reboot properly if the HOME Button is pressed during the display of a &quot;card removed&quot; error.</li>
          <li>Child applications cannot be booted after a DUP operation (a system update distributed via Download Play).</li>
          <li>After a child application is rebooted, button input has the effect of making it impossible to advance past the &quot;Press A to start&quot; screen.</li>
          <li>If the system transitions to wireless-disabled mode while <CODE>nn::uds::Scan</CODE> is running, the <CODE>Scan</CODE> function is supposed to return <CODE>ResultWirelessOff</CODE>, but it currently returns <CODE>ResultInvalidState</CODE> instead.</li>
          <li>In UDS, when the Master exits, a <CODE>Summary:11 Module:27 Desc:4</CODE> fatal error can sometimes occur.</li>
          <li>Demos started via the debugger do not run normally if the system is closed and the demo does not support Sleep Mode.</li>
          <li>A PID :0x00040130_00002D02 FATAL error sometimes occurs when wireless communications are enabled. The incidence of this error has been reduced in CTR-SDK 0.14.9, but still occurs on rare occasions.<br /> To prevent this, disable wireless communications.</li>
          <li>Noise is sometimes introduced to sound sources satisfying the conditions listed below when using <CODE>INTERPOLATION_TYPE_LINEAR</CODE> as the voice interpolation method.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sources having a difference between adjacent samples of 32768 or higher when using 16-bit PCM.</li>
              </ul>
              This would apply to a -6dB square wave, for example.<br /> Do not use <CODE>INTERPOLATION_TYPE_LINEAR</CODE> with sound sources that meet the above conditions.<br /> Noise does not occur for sound sources that do not include a high-frequency component or sound sources where the amplitude remains within 16384 when using 16-bit PCM.<br />
          <li>There is a bug where the firmware update stops in the middle and recovery becomes impossible if System Updater is executed on early CTR test units whose serial number starts with AAA (for example, AAA300001231). Do not run System Updater on these test units.</li>

We made a revision to eliminate this risk.<br /> As a result of this bug fix, UDS communication can no longer take place between an up-to-date CTR system and one that has not yet been updated to this version of the CTR-SDK or later.<br /> Take note of this restriction if your development or testing teams use a mixture of different SDK versions.<br /></description></P>

        <ul>
<li>Holding down the POWER Button during a transition sometimes results in the shutdown notification not being sent very well, causing the shutdown process to take a long time.</li>
<li>The system sometimes does not reboot properly if the HOME Button is pressed during the display of a &quot;card removed&quot; error.</li>
<li>Child applications cannot be booted after a DUP operation (a system update distributed via Download Play).</li>
<li>If the system transitions to wireless-disabled mode while <CODE>nn::uds::Scan</CODE> is running, the <CODE>Scan</CODE> function is supposed to return <CODE>ResultWirelessOff</CODE>, but it currently returns <CODE>ResultInvalidState</CODE> instead.</li>
<li>In UDS, when the Master exits, a <CODE>Summary:11 Module:27 Desc:4</CODE> fatal error can sometimes occur.</li>
<li>Demos started via the debugger do not run normally if the system is closed and the demo does not support Sleep Mode.</li>
<li>A <CODE>PID :0x00040130_00002D02</CODE> FATAL error sometimes occurs when wireless communications are enabled. The incidence of this error has been reduced in CTR-SDK 0.14.9, but still occurs on rare occasions.<br />To prevent this, disable wireless communications.</li>
<li>Noise is sometimes introduced to sound sources satisfying the conditions listed below when using <CODE>INTERPOLATION_TYPE_LINEAR</CODE> as the voice interpolation method.</li>
              <ul>
<li>Sources having a difference between adjacent samples of 32768 or higher when using 16-bit PCM.</li>
              </ul>
This would apply to a -6dB square wave, for example.<br />Do not use <CODE>INTERPOLATION_TYPE_LINEAR</CODE> with sound sources that meet the above conditions.<br />Noise does not occur for sound sources that do not include a high-frequency component or sound sources where the amplitude remains within 16384 when using 16-bit PCM.<br />
<li>There is a bug where the firmware update stops in the middle and recovery becomes impossible if System Updater is executed on early CTR test units whose serial number starts with AAA (for example, AAA300001231). Do not run System Updater on these test units.</li>

<P><description>Revised so that the callback function configured using <CODE>applet::SetSleepCanceledCallback</CODE> is called when an application gets a sleep query when the system is closed, and then the system is opened again between when the reply is sent and the system actually goes to sleep.<br /> However, there is no need to configure this function when the time to go to sleep is short, or when you do not care if the system opens during a query.<br /><br /> Possible use cases for this function include when an application configures this callback because it might take some time to save data before going to sleep, and then when the system is opened and the callback called, the application quits saving data and returns <CODE>applet::REPLY_REJECT</CODE>.<br /></description></P>

<knownissues><description>
        <ul>
          <li>Demos started via the debugger do not run normally if the system is closed and the demo does not support sleep mode.  </li>
          <li>Sleep is not handled normally if sleep occurs during application or applet startup or shutdown. </li>
          <li>The system sometimes down not sleep normally if the HOME Button is pressed during the display of a &quot;card removed&quot; error.</li>
          <li>The back light will stop lighting if the system is closed and opened again during display of a FATAL error screen. </li>
          <li>There is a problem where the chance encounter daemon sometimes returns SESSION_CLOSED and the chance encounter library then becomes unusable. </li>
          <li>Noise was sometimes being introduced with sound sources satisfying the conditions listed below when using INTERPLATION_TYPE_LINEAR as the Voice interpolation method. </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sources having a difference between adjacent samples of 32768 or higher when using 16-bit PCM</li>
              </ul>
              This would apply to a -6-dB square wave, for example.<br /> Do not use INTERPOLATION_TYPE_LINEAR with sound sources that meet the above conditions.<br /> Noise is not generated for sound sources that do not include a high-frequency component or sounds sources where the amplitude remains within 16384 when using 16-bit PCM.<br />
          <li>There is a bug where execution of firmware updates stops in the middle and recovery becomes impossible if System Updater is executed on development hardware whose serial number starts with AAA (for example, AAA300001231). Do not run System Updater on this hardware.</li>
          <li>Save data access is not thread-safe.</li>

          <li>Sleep is not performed correctly if sleep is initiated immediately after pressing the HOME Button or Power Button. </li>
          <li>There is a problem where, depending on the timing, background communications are not being switched correctly when combining sleep and WiFi on/off switching. </li>
          <li>A FATAL error sometimes results if the uds::DestroyEndPoint function is called after recovering from sleep. </li>
          <li>Before displaying a FATAL error on the screen, the upper and lower LCD screens sometimes distort, and then the LCDs go black without showing the FATAL error screen. </li>
          <li>The system sometimes down not sleep normally if the HOME Button is pressed during the display of a &quot;card removed&quot; error.</li>
          <li>The back light will stop lighting if the system is closed and opened again during display of a FATAL error screen. </li>
          <li>There is a problem where the chance encounter daemon sometimes returns SESSION_CLOSED and the chance encounter library then becomes unusable. </li>
          <li>Child devices downloaded from using DlpClient are removed upon restart.<br /> Therefore, each time DlpClient is started, download must be made for child devices regardless of the version.  Note that the child device can be booted after download. </li>

<P><description>To reduce power consumption and avoid communicating over and over with the same partner, there is a feature where the local host remembers what partners it has communicated with once (sent or received one or more pieces of data) and then does not communicate with those partners if they are discovered again.<br /> The list of past communication partners is valid for a maximum of 8 hours.<br /> For this reason, StreetPass with the same partner will not occur again until an average of 4 hours or a maximum of 8 hours elapses.<br /><br /> If you specify <CODE>true</CODE> in an argument to the <CODE>CecControl::StartScanning</CODE> function, the list is initialized and it becomes possible to communicate with the same partners again.<br /> Use this method when it is necessary to communicate more than once with the same partner for debug purposes.<br /> The list is also initialized when a StreetPass box has been deleted.<br /> (In the previous version the list was also initialized when data was written to an outbox, but that specification has been removed.)<br /></description></P>

First, the screen used to turn extremely dark for four frames after this function was run. Now, when the brightness of the two camera images is very different, the screen turns extremely bright for three frames after this function is run. Second, it still takes as long as before for the auto-exposure to stabilize.<br /></description></P>

<knownissues><description>
        <ul>
          <li>The <CODE>nn::fs::GetRomRequiredMemorySize</CODE> function has been confirmed to return incorrect values when it is called with <SPAN class="argument">useCache</SPAN> set to <CODE>true</CODE>. Because you may encounter memory corruption or other fatal errors if you use these values to mount a ROM, pass the sum of the following values to <CODE>nn::fs::MountRom</CODE>.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The value obtained from <CODE>nn::fs::GetRomRequiredMemorySize</CODE> with <SPAN class="argument">useCache</SPAN> set to <CODE>false</CODE></li>
                <li>(the number of files in the ROM) * 64 bytes</li>
                <li>(the number of directories in the ROM) * 64 bytes</li>
                <li>1 KB</li>
              </ul>
          <li>The <CODE>nn::fs::FormatSaveData</CODE> function parses the <SPAN class="argument">maxFiles</SPAN> and <SPAN class="argument">maxDirectories</SPAN> arguments in reverse. To deal with this, pass the opposite values as arguments in CTR-SDK 0.11.</li>
          <li>The FS library may not always be thread-safe in its timing. Further details are still under investigation, but please inform us if you encounter any symptoms that you think may be caused by this.</li>
          <li>The <CODE>statusUpdateEvent</CODE> that is signaled when a system connects to a network as a Master or Client is not signaled when the same system connects as an Audience.</li>
          <li>You cannot use the following functions in the profanity library.
              <ul>
                <li>The <CODE>CheckProfanityWords</CODE> function that checks all regions</li>
                <li>The <CODE>CheckProfanityWords</CODE> function that checks each region separately, called using <CODE>CFG_REGION_TAIWAN</CODE></li>
              </ul>
              The <CODE>ngc_simple</CODE> demo therefore does not run properly.
          </li>
          <li>After you have connected to your first communication partner and finished communication, you cannot communicate with another partner. Both systems must be reset to communicate again. Communication data that has been sent and received is saved on the SD card and is therefore not erased even after a reset.</li>
          <li>The Power Button originally needed to be pressed for two or more seconds to start the shutdown process, but because of a bug the system may shut down even if the Power Button is held down for a shorter period of time.</li>

<H3><A name="note33-27">Note 33-27: (GX) Restrictions on Using the L4 and A4 formats [SDK]</A></H3>
<P><description>It is now confirmed that hardware restrictions require that data in 4-bit texture formats (L4 or A4) be placed in a different memory region than data in non-4-bit formats when both types of texture formats are enabled at the same time and are used for multitextures.<br /> (The ETC format is treated as a non-4-bit format for the purposes of these restrictions.)<br /><br />
 <B>Note:</B> This restriction is described as above in the current specifications, but further tests have revealed that when data that uses a 4-bit format is placed in main memory (FCRAM), multitexture rendering is possible regardless of where data that uses a non-4-bit format is placed.<br /> (The specifications will be updated in the next release.)<br /></description></P>

          <li>Changed specifications and other areas in a way that breaks compatibility (this cannot be circumvented even with <CODE>gx_MacroOld.h</CODE>).</li>
<br />You must address the following issues if they apply to any macros that you are using. Otherwise, build errors and unintended behavior might occur.
          <ul>
            <li>Enumerated type constant definitions for the comparison functions for alpha tests, depth tests, and stencil tests (<CODE>PICA_DATA_ALPHA_TEST_*</CODE>) have been changed from 32-bit values (which accounted for the position of the bit that was set in the register) to 1-bit values. <br /><CODE>PICA_CMD_DATA_DEPTH_COLOR_MASK</CODE>, <CODE>PICA_CMD_DATA_STENCIL_TEST</CODE>, and <CODE>PICA_CMD_DATA_FRAG_OP_ALPHA_TEST</CODE> were changed along with these.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>Set the upper screen as the target, clear the framebuffer, complete rendering, and then send the results to the display buffer and swap the buffer.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The upper and lower screens now share one framebuffer object (color buffer / depth buffer) to reduce VRAM usage.<br /> Consequently, when rendering to both the upper and lower screens, rendering alternately to the upper and lower screens will produce a mixed display of the rendering results, so instead first complete rendering to one target screen and then proceed to rendering for the next.</li>
              For example, you can render to both the upper and lower screens as follows.<br />
            <ol>
              <li>Set the upper screen as the target, clear the framebuffer, complete rendering, and then send the results to the display buffer and swap the buffer.</li>

<P><description>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed the following bugs in the DMPGL 2.0 drivers:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In previous versions of the SDK, the <SPAN class="argument">progs</SPAN> argument in the <CODE>glRestoreProgramsDMP</CODE> function did not follow the specifications. Specifically, if an invalid value for <SPAN class="argument">progs</SPAN> (for example, a null pointer) was passed to the function, the error <CODE>GL_INVALID_VALUE</CODE> would result instead of the expected error <CODE>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</CODE>. This has been corrected.</li>
              <li>Similarly, in previous versions of the SDK, if a nonzero value was specified for the <SPAN class="argument">level</SPAN> argument to the <CODE>glCopyTexImage2D</CODE> or <CODE>glCopyTexSubImage2D</CODE> functions, the error <CODE>GL_INVALID_VALUE</CODE> would occur instead of the expected value of <CODE>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</CODE>. This has been corrected.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Added and revised the following features of the DMPGL 2.0 drivers:</li>

              <li>Changed <CODE>GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_DMP</CODE> to <CODE>GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT</CODE></li>
              <li>Added support for 32-block format (added the <CODE>glRenderBlockModeDMP</CODE> function)</li>
              <li>The <CODE>glGet</CODE> function now supports <CODE>GL_TEXTURE_COLLECTION_BINDING_DMP</CODE></li>

                  <li>Added the reserved uniforms <CODE>dmp_Texture[2].texcoord</CODE> and <CODE>dmp_Texture[3].texcoord</CODE></li>
                  <li>The texture coordinates for procedural textures used by the particle system shader can now be output to <CODE>GL_TEXTURE2</CODE></li>
                </ul>
              <li>Revised the following specifications for vertex shader uniforms:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Changed all MAT-type uniforms so that they can be handled as arrays of VEC-type data</li>
                  <li><CODE>VEC</CODE>-type arrays can now be set using both the <CODE>glUniformf</CODE> and <CODE>glUniformMatrixf</CODE> functions</li>
                  <li><CODE>GL_TRUE</CODE> can now be specified for the <SPAN class="argument">transpose</SPAN> argument to the <CODE>glUniformMatrix</CODE> function</li>
                  <li>Made it possible to specify individual elements within a <CODE>VEC</CODE>-type array by adding an offset to the location value obtained using the <CODE>glGetUniformLocation</CODE> function.</li>
                  <li>Changed the upper limit of the number of uniforms within vertex shaders and geometry shaders that can be linked to a single program object to 2048.</li>
                  <li>Established an upper limit of 8191 on the number of program objects that can be used simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Changed <CODE>GL_REPEAT</CODE> to <CODE>GL_SYMMETRICAL_REPEAT_DMP</CODE> for the reserved uniforms <CODE>dmp_Texture[3].ptClampU</CODE> and <CODE>dmp_Texture[3].ptClampV</CODE></li>
              <li>Changed <CODE>GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT_DMP</CODE> to <CODE>GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT</CODE></li>
              <li>Added <CODE>GL_TEXTURE3</CODE> to the values that can be set for the reserved uniform <CODE>dmp_LightEnv.bumpSelector</CODE></li>
              <li>Added <CODE>GL_TEXTURE1</CODE>, <CODE>GL_TEXTURE2</CODE>, and <CODE>GL_TEXTURE3</CODE> to the values that can be set for the reserved uniform <CODE>dmp_LightEnv.shadowSelector</CODE></li>
              <li>Added the following features for the command state cache:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added an argument for checking the buffer size to the &quot;save&quot; API</li>
                  <li>Added an argument for specifying the first object to the &quot;restore&quot; API</li>
                  <li>Added vertex shader uniforms and flags for restoring geometry shader uniform to the program state restoration API</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Bindings to object 0 within a <CODE>LUT</CODE> texture are now considered to be detached, and will no longer cause errors</li>
              <li>Added the <CODE>glTexSubImage1D</CODE> function</li>
              <li>Added error checking if <CODE>GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0</CODE> is provided as the second argument to the <CODE>glFramebufferRenderbuffer</CODE> function (<SPAN class="argument">attachment</SPAN>).</li>
              <li>Changed the specifications so that <CODE>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</CODE> will occur if an invalid color format is specified for the renderbuffer (or if the color format is anything other than <CODE>GL_GAS_DMP</CODE>)</li>
              <li>In previous versions of the SDK, the error <CODE>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</CODE> would occur during error-checking within the <CODE>glReadPixels</CODE> function if the framebuffer was set incorrectly. This has been corrected so that the error <CODE>GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION</CODE> will occur instead.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Fixed bugs with the point shader</li>

              <li>The use of <CODE>#pragma bind_symbol</CODE> to set multiple input registers is now treated as an error</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug in the code that checks for consecutive calls to the <CODE>mova</CODE> instruction</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Revised the following documents:</li>
            <ul>
